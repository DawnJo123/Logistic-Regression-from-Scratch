# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using Python, applied to the breast cancer dataset. Logistic Regression is a fundamental classification algorithm used in machine learning to predict binary outcomes.

## Overview

In this project, we build a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer data as malignant or benign. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset, which is available through the `sklearn` library.

## Features

- **Logistic Regression Implementation:** Building the model from scratch using Python without relying on high-level libraries.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Plotting decision boundaries and performance metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset. It contains features related to breast cancer diagnosis and the target variable indicates whether the cancer is malignant or benign.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DawnJo123/Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch.git
```
